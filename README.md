## AI SOLUTION
Earnlytics is a salary prediction AI designed to support financial planning and equitable compensation. It estimates salaries using age, gender, years of experience, and education. For managing company budgets, this AI enables accurate payroll forecasting while advancing fairness and transparency. This not only guards against underpayment but also improves financial stability and strengthens trust between management and staff.</p>


## Project overview
This project aims to develop an AI model that helps organizations like Accenture determine fair, unbiased, and data-driven salary allocations.
Using Python and Machine Learning, the system predicts appropriate salary ranges based on employee-related factors such as:

* Age <br>
* Gender<br>
* Education Level<br>
* Years of Experience <br>
* Job Title


## Theme and Relevance
The theme reflects the 4IR by the use of AI to impove decision-making and also reducing human bias, keeping the company from overspending and underspending while eliminating human Bias and promoting fairness and sustainability.



## Problem statment
